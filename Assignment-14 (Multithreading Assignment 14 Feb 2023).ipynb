    "#### Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "#### Ans 1.\n",
    "Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. \n",

    "Multithreading used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application.\n",

    "In Python, the threading module provides a very simple and intuitive API for spawning multiple threads in a program.\n",

    "* threading.activeCount() ---> Returns the number of thread objects that are active.\n",
    "* threading.currentThread() ---> Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.\n",

    "When two processes are competing with each other causing data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example two persons are trying to deposit 1 dollar online into the same bank account. The initial amount is 17 Rs. Both the persons would be able to see 17 Rs initially. Each of them tries to deposit 1 Rs, and the final amount is expected to be 19 Rs. But due to race conditions, the final amount in the bank is 18 Rs instead of 19 Rs. This is also known as dirty read.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common for the race conditions to go unnoticed during testing even after multiple tests and code reviews. But in production, there would be a lot of processes and threads working parallelly and compete for the same resources, and this problem would occur.\n",

    "#### Deadlock conditions :-\n",
    "\n",
    "When two processes are waiting for each other directly or indirectly, it is called deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "This usually occurs when two processes are waiting for shared resources acquired by others. For example, If thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplish its task. But the resource R2 is acquired by thread T2 which is waiting for resource R1(which is acquired by T1).. Neither of them will be able to accomplish its task, as they keep waiting for the other resources they need.\n"
